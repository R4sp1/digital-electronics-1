### 4-bit comparator

1. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`testbench.vhd`) with at least one assert (use BCD codes of your student ID digits as input combinations). Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

   Last two digits of my student ID: **73**
   
   | **Number** | **BCD code** |
   | :-: | :-: |
   |  7 | 0111 |
   |  3 | 0011 |

```vhdl
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        -- Report a note at the beginning of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

        -- First test case
        s_b <= "0111"; -- Such as "0101" if ID = xxxx56
        s_a <= "0011";        -- Such as "0110" if ID = xxxx56
        wait for 100 ns;
        -- Expected output
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = 'WRITE_CORRECT_VALUE_HERE') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = 'WRITE_CORRECT_VALUE_HERE') and
                (s_B_less_A    = 'WRITE_CORRECT_VALUE_HERE'))
        -- If false, then report an error
        report "Input combination COMPLETE_THIS_TEXT FAILED" severity error;

        -- Report a note at the end of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
    end process p_stimulus;
```
